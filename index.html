            FIRST 
          </div>
          <br><br>Kanan is a third year student living on the offshore island of Awashima with her grandfather, who runs a diving shop there. In the anime, she had a hard time attending classes as she must take care of the shop while her father recovers from a fractured bone. She is able to attend classes from Season 1 Episode 9 onwards. Kanan is childhood friends with Chika Takami, You Watanabe, Dia Kurosawa and Mari Ohara.<br><br>
<div class="sm-title">SECOND</div><br><br>
 Breezily mature, Kanan rarely sweats the details and usually maintains a calm, cool and even stoic demeanor. Though she may seem a bit bland at first, she loves sports and nature, claiming that she is happy every day just by being able to see the dazzling sun, the blue skies and the sea. She isn't as talkative as her fellow third years, speaking the least of them in the anime, but is nevertheless friendly and laid-back.
          <div class="sm-title">Third</div><br><br>
       Kanan is a very kind, warm-hearted and altruistic individual. She deeply cares for her friends, being very supportive and often putting their needs above her own, going to great lengths to ensure they get what she thinks is best for them. However, due to this, Kanan can fail to realize the others' feelings the same way she does, and she will go to the same lengths to hide the truth if it will hurt the person. This particularly caused her friend, Mari, to accept the chance of studying abroad when in reality she didn't want to, as Mari was content with being with her friends.   
<div class="sm-title">Fourth</div><br><br>
Although Kanan is intelligent and level-headed, she doesn't get very good grades. This is due to her poor attendance at school due to the fact she must help her family with work; with that said, it's also seen she doesn't like reading and easily gets tired of it.
<div class="sm-title">Fifth</div><br><br>
While athletic, mature and composed, Kanan has a sweet and soft personality. She is also afraid of strange, creaking sounds as seen in Season 2 Episode 2, and afraid of heights as seen in Season 2 Episode 8. She also likes hugs ever since her childhood, and will often hug her friends if given the opportunity, usually declaring her catchphrase "Hagu shiyo" (ハグしよ "Let's hug") before so.
<div class="sm-title">Sixth</div><br><br>
Kanan has an athletic figure. She has long dark blue hair that she ties up into a high ponytail and purple eyes. She's often considered to be physically very attractive.
